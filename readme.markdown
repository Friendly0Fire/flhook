## What is FLHook?

FLHook is a server improvement suite and SDK for the arcade space shooter game, Freelancer (2003). FLHook provides many bug fixes and quality of life improvements to the original FLServer, and provides an extensive SDK for writing plugins to further expand what the server is capable of.

Additional information regarding usage, installation, and development can be viewed over at our [docs](https://docs.flhook.org)!
