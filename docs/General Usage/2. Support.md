## Support

If you face issues or discover bugs while using FLHook, you can get support via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/c6wtsBk) or by making a post over on the Starport [forums](https://the-starport.net). If you discover behaviour that you are fairly sure is a bug, issue reports can be made directly in the [issue](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition/issues) section. Additionally, if you would like to request a new feature or plugin, you may also make an issue within this repo and tag it as `proposal` and `plugin request`.
