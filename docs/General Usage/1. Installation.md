## Installation

After downloading your desired release the following steps can done in order to get FLHook in working order.

1. Copy all files from the release folder to the EXE folder of your Freelancer install.
2. Open up EXE/dacomsrv.ini in your desired text editor
3. Add FLHook.dll at the bottom of the `Libraries` section

### Nothing has changed!
In the event that you don't get a 'FLHook Console' opening after starting your server, you might have missing dependencies. FLHook requires [VC++ redist 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) in order to run, and is only actively supported on Windows 10 onwards. There are reports that it will run on Windows 8.1 successfully, provided that said machine is x64 architecture. When installing the redist, ensure that you have downloaded both the x86 and x64 variants.
