# Command Vector and User Commands

FlHook 4.0 provides a simpler and more compact way to register console commands into FlHook to be evoked by a player.

Lets go over a quick example from the bounty hunt plugin.

```cpp

	const std::vector commands = {{
	    CreateUserCommand(L"/bountyhunt", L"<charname> <credits> [minutes]", UserCmdBountyHunt,
	        L"Places a bounty on the specified player. When another player kills them, they gain <credits>."),
	    CreateUserCommand(
	        L"/bountyhuntid", L"<id> <credits> [minutes]", UserCmdBountyHuntID, L"Same as above but with an id instead of a player name. Use /ids"),
	}};

```

### The Commands Vector

Commands vector itself is a vector of UserCommand. We generate the UserCommand by the conveniently named CreateUserCommand

### CreateUserCommand

CreateUserCommand takes 4 arguments, 
 - First one is a wide string of the name of the command 
 - Second is the arguments it takes, <'name'> indicates that the field is required for, the command to work, \[Argument\] indicates it is optional, 
 - Third argument is the function itself, all functions for this must return void and have the arguments of (ClientId client, const std::wstring& param)
 - Fourth argument is help text communicating what the command does and how to use it.
