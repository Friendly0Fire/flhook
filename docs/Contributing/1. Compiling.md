## Compiling

Starting with version 4.0, Visual Studio 2022 is required. To compile, simply build the solution as normal. The final build will be found in `dist`, whereas intermediate files are located in `int` and `bin`. 

If you would like the build process to copy FLHook as well as any enabled plugin, you may set the `FLHOOK_COPY_PATH` environment variable to your `.\EXE` directory. If it is not set, no such copy will occur. Unlike the `dist` folder structure, no configuration subfolder will be created, so Debug and Release builds will overwrite one another.

### General Compiling Instructions

1. Install Visual Studio 2022, required toolchains/modules are: `MSVC v143 (x86), C++ MFC for v143 build tools, C++ ATL for v143 build tools, C++/CLI support for v143 build tools.`
2. If you don't already have vcpkg installed and setup, do so. Instructions available here: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master#quick-start-windows - Ensure you do the steps pertaining to Visual Studio.
3. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/fl-devs/FLHook.git`)
4. Open `project\FLHook.sln`
5. Ensure you are on `Release` (or `ReleaseWithDebug` for development) and build the solution.
6. Build Solution. vcpkg should download a number of dependencies.
